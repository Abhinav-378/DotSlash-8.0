I understand the need to provide free meals for low-income students, but why should taxpayers fund meals for children whose families can easily afford them? A targeted program for those who actually need it would be more cost-effective instead of making it universal. Resources could be better spent improving education or funding school supplies

Offering free meals to all students is a wonderful initiative, but there have been concerns in the past about the quality of school lunches. Many meals are highly processed and lack proper nutrients. While I appreciate the effort to source local produce, the program should include strict nutrition guidelines and regular quality checks to ensure children are receiving truly healthy meals
